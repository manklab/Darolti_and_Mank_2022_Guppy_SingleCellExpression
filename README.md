This repository is associated with the paper entitled "Sex-biased gene expression at single-cell resolution: Cause and consequence of sexual dimorphism" by Darolti and Mank. It contains scripts used for scRNA-seq data processing, data clustering, differential cell type abundance analysis, sex-biased gene expression analysis, and analysis of coding-sequence evolution.
